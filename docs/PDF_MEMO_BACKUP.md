## Image Handling

- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

Maximum size: 600px tall, 450px wide (auto-fits)

### Other Files

PDFs, Word docs, etc. are listed by filename but not embedded.

## Testing

1. **Create a memo** with text content
2. **Attach an image** (JPG, PNG, etc.)
3. **Send the memo**
4. **Check Google Drive** folder
5. **Download the PDF**
6. **Open the PDF** - you'll see the image embedded!

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing in PDF

**Cause**: Image format not supported or corrupted
**Solution**:

- Use JPEG or PNG format
- Ensure image file is not corrupted
- Check file size (not too large)

### PDF Too Large

**Cause**: Many large images
**Solution**:

- Compress images before uploading
- Reduce image dimensions
- Split into multiple memos

### "Image could not be embedded"

**Check server console** for the specific error
**Common causes**:

- Unsupported image format
- Corrupted image file
- File path not found

**Note**: Memo PDF will still be created, just without that image.
