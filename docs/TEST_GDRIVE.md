# âœ… Google Drive is Connected!

Now let's test if it's working properly.

## Quick Test

### Step 1: Check Server Console

Look at your server console - you should see the connection was successful. It should show something like tokens being saved.

### Step 2: Create a Test Memo

1. Go back to your Memofy dashboard
2. Click "Compose" or create a new memo
3. Fill in the details:
   - To: [any recipient email]
   - Subject: "Test Memo - Google Drive Backup"
   - Content: "This is a test memo to verify Google Drive backup is working."
4. Click "Send"

### Step 3: Check the Server Console

After sending, watch your server console. You should see:

```
[Google Drive] Connection status: true
[Google Drive] Attempting to upload memo: Test Memo - Google Drive Backup
âœ“ Memo backed up to Google Drive: [file_id]
  Memo: Test Memo - Google Drive Backup
```

### Step 4: Check Your Google Drive

Wait 10-30 seconds, then check your folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XoY3mVtdaneUOdA0jxnI_cLKSOL3JQ_L

You should see a new file like:

- **Name**: `Test Memo - Google Drive Backup - 2025-01-15`
- **Type**: Google Docs document
- **Content**: All memo details (Subject, From, To, Department, Date, Content)

---

## What's Working Now

âœ… **Google Drive is Connected** - System has authorization
âœ… **Automatic Backup** - All memos will backup automatically
âœ… **Your Folder** - Using: Memofy_Backup_Storage (ID: 1XoY3mVtdaneUOdA0jxnI_cLKSOL3JQ_L)
âœ… **One Shared Folder** - All Secretaries and Admins save to the same folder

---

## Troubleshooting

### If You See Errors in Console

**Error: "Google Drive has not been connected to the system"**

- The connection might not have saved properly
- Try visiting `/api/drive/authorize` again

**Error: "Token expired, refreshing..."**

- This is normal - the system auto-refreshes tokens
- Should work automatically

**Error: "Folder not found"**

- The folder ID might be incorrect
- Make sure the folder exists in your Google Drive

### If Memo Doesn't Appear in Google Drive

1. **Check server console for errors**

   - Look for lines starting with `âœ—`

2. **Verify folder ID**

   ```bash
   node backend/scripts/checkDriveStatus.js
   ```

3. **Check permissions**

   - Make sure the Google account you authorized owns the folder

4. **Check internet connection**
   - Upload needs active internet connection

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Console shows**: `âœ“ Memo backed up to Google Drive`
âœ… **File appears** in your Google Drive folder
âœ… **File is a Google Docs document** with all memo details
âœ… **Automatic**: Future memos backup without any action needed

---

## What Happens Now

Every time a Secretary or Admin creates a memo:

1. It's saved to the database âœ“
2. It shows in Recent Memos âœ“
3. **It's automatically backed up to Google Drive** âœ“
4. It appears in your Memofy_Backup_Storage folder âœ“

**No action needed** - it works automatically! ðŸŽ‰
