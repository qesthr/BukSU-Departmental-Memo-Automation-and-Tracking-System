# âœ… Fixed: PDF Now Embeds Images

## The Problem

"Created PDF with 0 embedded images" - attachments were not being passed to the PDF creation function.

## The Root Cause

When using `.lean()` to get a plain JavaScript object from MongoDB, the attachments array was getting lost in the transfer.

## The Fix

Now explicitly copying attachments to the populated memo object:

```javascript
populatedMemo.attachments = memo.attachments;
```

## What's Fixed

âœ… **Attachments are now preserved** when passing memo to PDF creation
âœ… **Images will now embed** in the PDF
âœ… **Console logging** shows attachment count: "Memo has X attachments"

## Test It Now

1. **Create a memo with an image**
2. **Send it**
3. **Watch console** - you should see:
   ```
   [Google Drive] Memo has 1 attachments
   Creating PDF file...
   âœ“ Uploaded attachment: photo.jpg
   âœ“ Created PDF with 1 embedded images
   ```
4. **Check Google Drive** - PDF will have the image!

## What You'll See

**Console output:**

```
[Google Drive] Connection status: true
[Google Drive] Memo has 1 attachments
[Google Drive] Attempting to upload memo: Test Memo
  Creating PDF file...
  PDF created, uploading to Google Drive...
  PDF uploaded successfully, cleaning up...
  âœ“ Created PDF with 1 embedded images
  âœ“ PDF uploaded to Google Drive: [file_id]
âœ“ Memo backed up to Google Drive: [file_id]
```

**In Google Drive:**

- PDF file with **images embedded inside** it!
