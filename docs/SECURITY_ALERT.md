# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue: Environment File (.env) Was Committed to Repository

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Discovered:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTIVE SECURITY RISK**

---

## What Happened?

A `.env` file containing **sensitive credentials** was committed to the Git repository and pushed to GitHub. This file should **NEVER** be committed as it contains:

- MongoDB connection string with credentials
- Database username and password
- Cluster information

### Exposed Content:
```
mongodb_uri=mongodb+srv://qesthr:<db_password>@memocluster.hpe67et.mongodb.net/users?...
```

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Rotate All Credentials (DO THIS NOW!)

#### MongoDB Atlas:
1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas Console** ‚Üí https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. **Change Database Password:**
   - Go to Database Access
   - Find user "qesthr"
   - Click "Edit"
   - Click "Edit Password"
   - Generate a new strong password
   - Save changes

3. **Update Connection String:**
   - Update your local `.env` file with the new password
   - Never commit this file again

4. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Check MongoDB Atlas logs for any unauthorized access
   - Look for suspicious IP addresses or queries

### 2. Remove File from Git History

The `.env` file has been removed from the repository in this commit, but it still exists in the Git history. To completely remove it:

```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites Git history and requires force push
# Coordinate with your team before doing this!

# Install BFG Repo-Cleaner
# Download from: https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Remove .env from all commits
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files .env

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push (WARNING: Coordinate with team!)
git push origin --force --all
```

**Alternative (safer for public repos):**
Since this is a public repository, consider:
1. Rotating all credentials (already done above)
2. Leaving the history as-is but securing credentials
3. Adding monitoring for unauthorized access

---

## üîí Prevention Measures (Already Implemented)

### ‚úÖ What We've Done:

1. **Removed .env from tracking:**
   ```bash
   git rm .env
   ```

2. **Verified .gitignore:**
   The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`:
   ```
   .env
   ```

3. **Created .env.example:**
   A template file without sensitive data is now available

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Still Needs to Be Done:

1. **Rotate MongoDB credentials** (see instructions above)
2. **Review Git commit history** for other sensitive data
3. **Set up pre-commit hooks** to prevent future commits:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev husky
   npx husky init
   ```

4. **Scan repository for secrets:**
   ```bash
   # Use git-secrets or similar tool
   git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets
   cd git-secrets
   make install
   cd ../your-project
   git secrets --install
   git secrets --scan
   ```

## üìã Security Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Changed MongoDB password in Atlas
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Updated local .env with new credentials
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Verified .env is in .gitignore
- [ ] **HIGH:** Reviewed MongoDB access logs
- [ ] **HIGH:** Checked for unauthorized database access
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Consider removing .env from Git history
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Set up git-secrets or similar tool
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Implement pre-commit hooks
- [ ] **LOW:** Enable MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
- [ ] **LOW:** Enable MongoDB Atlas alerts
- [ ] **LOW:** Review and rotate Google OAuth credentials (if exposed)
- [ ] **LOW:** Review session secret (generate new one)

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices Going Forward

### Never Commit These Files:
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `.env.local` - Local environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment
- Any file with credentials, API keys, or secrets

### Always Use:
- `.env.example` - Template without real values
- Environment variables in deployment platforms
- Secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)

### Use These Tools:
- **git-secrets** - Prevents committing secrets
- **husky** - Pre-commit hooks
- **dotenv-vault** - Encrypted environment variables
- **GitHub Secret Scanning** - Already enabled for public repos

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### What Was Exposed:
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection string
- ‚úÖ Database username (qesthr)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database password (partially masked as `<db_password>`)
- ‚úÖ Cluster hostname (memocluster.hpe67et.mongodb.net)
- ‚úÖ Database name (users)

### Who Could Access It:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone with access to the GitHub repository
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone who cloned/forked the repository
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Web crawlers indexing GitHub
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Automated secret scanning tools

### Potential Risks:
- üî¥ Unauthorized database access
- üî¥ Data theft or manipulation
- üî¥ Database deletion
- üü° Resource usage (crypto mining, etc.)
- üü° Reputation damage

---

## üîç How to Check for Unauthorized Access

### MongoDB Atlas:
1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
2. Go to your cluster
3. Click "Metrics" tab
4. Check for:
   - Unusual connection spikes
   - Connections from unknown IP addresses
   - Unusual query patterns
   - Storage usage changes

### What to Look For:
- Connections from IPs you don't recognize
- Activity during hours you weren't working
- Unexpected data modifications
- New users or collections created

---

## üìû Who to Contact

If you discover unauthorized access:

1. **Immediately:**
   - Rotate all credentials
   - Review database for unauthorized changes
   - Check application logs

2. **Document:**
   - What was accessed
   - When it was accessed
   - What actions were taken

3. **Report:**
   - To your team lead
   - To your security team (if applicable)
   - To affected users (if data was compromised)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After rotating credentials, verify:

```bash
# 1. Ensure .env is not tracked
git ls-files | grep .env
# Should return nothing

# 2. Verify .env is in .gitignore
cat .gitignore | grep .env
# Should show: .env

# 3. Check current git status
git status
# Should not show .env as modified or untracked if it exists locally

# 4. Test with new credentials
npm start
# Application should start successfully with new MongoDB credentials
```
