# TODO: Fix Google Auth Modal Hanging Issue

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add timeout mechanism to GSI initialization (10 seconds) to fall back to traditional OAuth if GSI fails to load or respond.
- [x] Add timeout to handleCredentialResponse fetch request to prevent hanging during backend authentication.
- [x] Add a global timeout for the modal interaction to ensure fallback if no credential response within 15 seconds after button click.
- [x] Test the changes by running the application and attempting Google sign-in to verify fallback works.
- [x] Check browser console for any errors or logs related to timeouts and fallbacks.
